    v0 (float or numpy.ndarray): Initial starting point for the gradient descent algorithm. 
                                 Default is 0.0. Can be a scalar or numpy array for multi-dimensional inputs.
    lr (float): Learning rate, determining the step size at each iteration. Default is 0.01.
    eps (float): Convergence criterion. The algorithm stops if the step size is smaller than eps. Default is 1e-4.
    nmax (int): Maximum number of iterations. Default is 1000.
    history (bool): If True, the function returns the history of optimization steps. Default is True.

    Returns:
    tuple: Contains the optimal value, a boolean indicating convergence, and the history of iterations.
           The history is returned as a tuple of numpy arrays representing the variable values and function values.
